Cheers! 

Officially Michael but everyone calls me "Mitch", so lets stick to that. I was working as Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer and currently I call myself Lead Software Engineer. Friends of mine say that I am especially interested in building true teams, agile workenvironments, software architecture and of course technology.

So far I have been working for:

- [Workplace Solutions GmbH](https://www.wps.de/en/) (Hamburg, Germany)
- [Propellerhead Ltd](https://propellerhead.co.nz) (Auckland, New Zealand)
- [Fergus Software Ltd](https://fergus.com) (Auckland, New Zealand)

I'd love to build a startup!
